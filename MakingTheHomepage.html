  <h1>Making the Home Page</h1>
  <h3>How will this site look like?</h3>
  <img src="FlowChart%20for%20SIte%20(AfterContact).png"/>

  <h3>Wireframing</h3>
  <p>1st Idea</p>
  <img src="WireFrame1stTOM.png" style="width:500px; height:300px"/>
  <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
    <li>the pictures are spamming the page</li>
    <ul><li>doesn't look pleasant to the eye and it's very messy, so it's hard to focus on the most important information</li></ul>
  </ul>
  <p>2nd Idea</p>
  <img src="wireframeYEBIN01.png"/>
  <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
    <li>this wireframe didn't include the signup aspect</li>
    <li>this also didn't include contact list</li>
        <ul><li>so if the audience encounters a problem, they might not know who to contact (doesn't solve problem of miscommunication)</li></ul>
  </ul>
  <p>3rd Idea</p>
  <img src="wireframeYEBIN02.png"/>
  <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
    <li>a picture slideshow doesn't help the audience to signup for volunteer</li>
    <li>a description of winter fair is also not necessary</li>
    <ul><li>because the audience should already know what the winter fair is before coming to the site</li></ul>
  </ul>
  <p>4th Idea</p>
  <img src="WireFrame01.png" style="width:500px; height:300px"/>
  <ul>This was the <strong>CHOSEN</strong> idea, but why?
    <li>shows the main point and is easy to understand</li>
    <li>also if the audience has trouble, the description should be able to help, if not, there are a list of contacts</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>But there are still somethings that this layout can't do, like...
    <li>doesn't have pictures to draw in interest</li>
    <li>maybe there is an easier way to signup rather than clicking on each individual link to signup</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>To-Do List</h3>
  <ul><li>for after creating the wireframe</li></ul>
  <ol>
    <li>get approval from client</li>
    <li>move on an create storyboard<li>
      <ol>
        <li>chose colors, images, fonts to replace gray squares</li>
        <li>replace and resize</li>
        <li>save</li>
      </ol>
      <li>get approval (make changes if needed)</li>
      <li>make file with clickable links in Fireworks</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Storyboard</h3>
  <p>Ideas for Themes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AIS color scheme (blue, red, white)</li>
      <li>Winter theme, because it's <strong>WINTER</strong> Fair</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Progress</p>
  <img src="StoryBoardProgress01.png"/>
    <ul>Feedback/Questions to think about
      <li>If "Sign Up!" is the call-to-action, why would the contact list be next to it? Doesn't it distract the audience?</li>
      <ul><li>I want it there because it helps the audience to correspond the contact list with the volunteering list</li></ul>
      <li>How would the call-to-action stand out?</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    <img src="StoryBoardProgress02.png"/>
    <p>This image above is the storyboard and how I sliced the page up to create my prototype</p>
    <p>Click <a href="HTDocs/index-FW.htm">here</a> to see actual Fireworks file.</p>
    <ol>How did I create it?
      <li>after I finish editing the storyboard (adding colors and such), I have to slice it</li>
      <li>link up sliced images to links</li>
      <li>then, export</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Pro's and Con's of Fireworks for Webpage</h3>
  <p>The storyboards above are made in Fireworks.</p>
    <ul>Pro's
      <li>allows quick editing</li>
      <ul>
        <li>through slicing and linking<li>
        <li>allows you to just draw shapes and no need to code</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
    <ul>Con's
      <li>if you want to edit something, you will have to go back to original Fireworks file to edit it</li>
      <ul><li>becomes very difficult as you will have to export again</li></ul>
    </ul>

  <h3>Prototyping Continued</h3>
  <p>Next, I did another homepage in <a href="HTDocs/index-DW.html">Dream Weaver</a>.</p>
  <img src="StoryBoard02.png"/>
  <ol>How was this created?
    <li>Wireframe was recreated with boxes to outline the sections in the page</li>
    <li>Then, using CSS rules, the boxes are customized to make the webpage</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Pro's and Con's of Dream Weaver for Webpage</h3>
  <ul>Pro's
    <li>allows easy wireframing</li>
    <ul><li>as you can just click and drag</li></ul>
    <li>allows easy and precise editing</li>
    <ul><li>uses CSS for precise numbers and values</li></ul>
    <li>allows quick edits and changes</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>Con's
    <li>time-consuming to use CSS to edit</li>
    <li>can't insert gradient colors or multiple patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Is this Website User-Based?</h3>
  <p>Looking at the homepage, the site is not as user-based than an ideal site.</p>
  <p>Maybe using Google Forms will be easier for the users to navigate, like <a ref="http://goo.gl/forms/losVxPc2jL">this</a>.</p>
  <p>This is an example of the new page</p>
