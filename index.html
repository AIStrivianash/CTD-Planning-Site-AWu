    <img src="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/Web%20Design/GitHub/CTD-Planning-Site-AWu/FlowChart%20for%20SIte%20(AfterContact).png"/>

    <p>Wireframing</p>
    <p>1st Idea</p>
    <img src="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/Web%20Design/GitHub/CTD-Planning-Site-AWu/WireFrame1stTOM.png"/>
      <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
        <li>the pictures are spamming the page</li>
          <ul><li>doesn't look pleasant to the eye and it's very messy, so it's hard to focus on the most important information</li></ul>
      </ul>
    <p>2nd Idea</p>
    <img src="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/Web%20Design/GitHub/CTD-Planning-Site-AWu/wireframeYEBIN01.png"/>
      <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
        <li>this wireframe didn't include the signup aspect</li>
        <li>this also didn't include contact list</li>
          <ul><li>so if the audience encounters a problem, they might not know who to contact (doesn't solve problem of miscommunication)</li></ul>
      </ul>
    <p>3rd Idea</p>
    <img src="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/Web%20Design/GitHub/CTD-Planning-Site-AWu/wireframeYEBIN02.png"/>
      <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
        <li></li>
      </ul>
