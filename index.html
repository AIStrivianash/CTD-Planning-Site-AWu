  <h1>CTD WebSite Design: Planning Site <em>by Ashley Wu</em></h1>
  <h3>Pages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="MakingTheHomepage.html">Making the Home Page</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Brainstorm Ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Human Rights Club</li>
        <ul>
          <li>used to have a website for projects that they did</li>
          <li>new site for agenda, planning (feedback/forum) and actual projects</li>
        </ul>
      <li>How to use an Ipad?</li>
        <p><span>Why a site like this?<span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>My grandma doesn't know how to use her Ipad very well, so this website will answer her questions whenever she forgets.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Art Share</li>
        <p><span>Why a site like this?<span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of big websites like deviantart.com, this can let people to upload their artwors among their friends and share.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <h3>Decided Idea</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Winter Fair Webpage</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>Making a webpage for the PTA to help them solve previous problems that they might have experienced.</span></p>

    <p>Before talking to the client:</p>
    <p><span>Idea of how the page is laid out</span></p>
    <img src="FlowChart%20for%20Site.png"/>

    <p>After talking to the client:</p>
    <ul>Client
      <li>PTA</li>
    </ul>
    <ul><strong>Audience (Client's & Our Group's)</strong>
      <li>Parents</li>
      <li>Volunteers</li>
    </ul>
  <ul><strong>Objectives (Client's Request)</strong>
    <li>for audience to be able to volunteer to help</li>
    <ul>
      <li>food donation</li>
      <li>set up</li>
      <li>clean up</li>
      <li>preparation</li>
      <li>multiple languages</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul><strong>Success Criteria (Our Group's)</strong>
    <li>for client to be able to effectively have their audience to volunteer</li>
      <ul>
        <li>easy to access</li>
        <li>simple, not complicated (appearance)</li>
        <li>signup quickly and finish</li>
      </ul>
    <li>signup form is on site</li>
    <li>contact list is on site (for any questions and concerns)</li>
    <li>upcoming news are on site</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How will this site look like?</h3>
  <img src="FlowChart%20for%20SIte%20(AfterContact).png"/>
  <p>Page Description:</p>
  <ul>Food Donation
    <li>has spreadsheet for people to sign up</li>
    <li>has description of what this particular help is</li>
      <ul>
        <li>what is the requirement?</li>
        <li>what kinds of food we need?</li>
        <li>which booth? (the Korean, Chinese or Japanese booth)
      </ul>
    <li>pictures</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>Set Up & Clean Up
    <li>has spreadsheet</li>
    <li>description of help</li>
      <ul>
        <li>what times are available?</li>
        <li>where to set up?</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>Preparation
    <li>has spreadsheet</li>
    <li>description of help</li>
      <ul>
        <li>which booth needs help?</li>
        <li>when, where and how?</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Wireframing</h3>
  <p>1st Idea</p>
  <img src="WireFrame1stTOM.png" style="width:500px; height:300px"/>
    <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
      <li>the pictures are spamming the page</li>
        <ul><li>doesn't look pleasant to the eye and it's very messy, so it's hard to focus on the most important information</li></ul>
    </ul>
  <p>2nd Idea</p>
  <img src="wireframeYEBIN01.png"/>
    <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
      <li>this wireframe didn't include the signup aspect</li>
      <li>this also didn't include contact list</li>
        <ul><li>so if the audience encounters a problem, they might not know who to contact (doesn't solve problem of miscommunication)</li></ul>
    </ul>
  <p>3rd Idea</p>
  <img src="wireframeYEBIN02.png"/>
    <ul>Why this idea wasn't used
      <li>a picture slideshow doesn't help the audience to signup for volunteer</li>
      <li>a description of winter fair is also not necessary</li>
        <ul><li>because the audience should already know what the winter fair is before coming to the site</li></ul>
    </ul>
  <p>4th Idea</p>
  <img src="WireFrame01.png" style="width:500px; height:300px"/>
    <ul>This was the <strong>CHOSEN</strong> idea, but why?
      <li>shows the main point and is easy to understand</li>
      <li>also if the audience has trouble, the description should be able to help, if not, there are a list of contacts</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>But there are still somethings that this layout can't do, like...
      <li>doesn't have pictures to draw in interest</li>
      <li>maybe there is an easier way to signup rather than clicking on each individual link to signup</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>To-Do List</h3>
    <ul><li>for after creating the wireframe</li></ul>
  <ol>
    <li>get approval from client</li>
    <li>move on an create storyboard<li>
      <ol>
        <li>chose colors, images, fonts to replace gray squares</li>
        <li>replace and resize</li>
        <li>save</li>
      </ol>
    <li>get approval (make changes if needed)</li>
    <li>make file with clickable links in Fireworks</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Storyboard</h3>
  <p>Ideas for Themes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AIS color scheme (blue, red, white)</li>
      <li>Winter theme, because it's <strong>WINTER</strong> Fair</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Progress</p>
  <img src="StoryBoardProgress01.png"/>
  <ul>Feedback/Questions to think about
    <li>If "Sign Up!" is the call-to-action, why would the contact list be next to it? Doesn't it distract the audience?</li>
      <ul><li>I want it there because it helps the audience to correspond the contact list with the volunteering list</li></ul>
    <li>How would the call-to-action stand out?</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="StoryBoardProgress02.png"/>
  <p>This image above is the storyboard and how I sliced the page up to create my prototype</p>
  <ol>How did I create it?
    <li>after I finish editing the storyboard (adding colors and such), I have to slice it</li>
    <li>link up sliced images to links</li>
    <li>then, export</li>
  </ol>
