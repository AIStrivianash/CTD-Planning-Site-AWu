  <h1>How to make the subpages?</h1>
  <p>This site will require some subpages that look the same. How will we manage that?</p>

  <h3>Making the Subpage Template</h3>
  <p>First, a template has to be made so that it makes creating the subpages much easier as each subpage has some qualities that remain the same.</p>
  <p>I created a template page on Dream Weaver.</p>

  <h3>Making Subpages</h3>
  <p>Then, I moved on to making the subpages.</p>
  <p>I edited the editable regions by adding the signup sheet on it and the picures.</p>

  <p>After that, I will need to create the subpages using the template. However, there is now an issue because I need to insert the Google Spreadsheet onto the page, but I DON'T KNOW HOW!</p>
  <p>After some research, I found that using the <em>i frame</em> tag and publishing the document will help me embed the document onto the page.</p>

  <h3>Feedback on the Website</h3>
  <p>I had a look at my website and tried using it as my audience.</p>
  <ul>What I thought
    <li>there are some broken links</li>
    <li>objectives are still fulfilled</li>
