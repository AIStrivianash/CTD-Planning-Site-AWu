  <h1>How to make the subpages?</h1>
  <p>This site will require some subpages that look the same. How will we manage that?</p>

  <h3>Making the Subpage Template</h3>
  <p>First, a template has to be made so that it makes creating the subpages much easier as each subpage has some qualities that remain the same.</p>
  <p>I created a template page on Dream Weaver.</p>

  <h3>Making Subpages</h3>
  <p>Then, I moved on to making the subpages.</p>
  <p>I edited the editable regions by adding the signup sheet on it and the picures.</p>

  <p>After that, I will need to create the subpages using the template. However, there is now an issue because I need to insert the Google Spreadsheet onto the page, but I DON'T KNOW HOW!</p>
  <p>After some research, I found that using the <em>iframe</em> tag and publishing the document will help me embed the document onto the page.</p>

  <h3>Feedback on the Website</h3>
  <p>I had a look at my website and tried using it as my audience.</p>
  <ul>What I thought:
    <li>there are some broken links</li>
    <li>objectives are still fulfilled</li>
    <li>the main page and the subpages are not very consistent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Then, I asked someone to use it as my audience and tell me what they thought</p>
  <ul>Her feedback:
    <li>logo size is good, doesn't take up too much space</li>
    <li>broken links!</li>
    <li>News section needs to be in a more noticable spot</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <p>After creating all my subpages (it's not complete though), I tried to see if it fit my objectives.</p>
  <ul>Notes
    <li>the MAIN homepage is not yet inserted</li>
    <ul>
      <li>so if it's there, the objective (for audience to know more about the Winter Fair) will be fulfilled</li>
    </ul>
    <li>the other objective is fulfilled</li>
    <li>as for the look and feel, I think that it has a very simple feel, but...</li>
    <ul>
      <li>the MAIN homepage and the subpages don't have much unity and feel</li>
      <li>so needs revising</li>
      <li>AFTER REVISING</li>
      <img src="tempSubProgress3.png"/>
    </ul>
    <li>for wireframing, since the client requested that the previous 'homepage' was to be made as a homepage, it was made according to that homepage</li>
    <ul>
      <li>the wireframe below shows the labled editable and non-editable region</li>
      <img src="templateWireframe02.png"/>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Subpages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index-DW.html">the Main Signup Subpage</a></li>
    <li><a href="SETUPSUB.html">the Signup Subpage for set up</a></li>
    <li><a href="DonationsSub.html">the Signup Subpage for donations</a></li>
    <li><a href="PrizeCornerPage.html">the Signup Subpage for the the Prize Corner</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The MAIN homepage has been changed to <a href="newhomepage.html">this</a>.(Click on link)</p>
