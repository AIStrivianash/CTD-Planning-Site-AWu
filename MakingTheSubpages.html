  <h1>How to make the subpages?</h1>
  <p>This site will require some subpages that look the same. How will we manage that?</p>

  <h3>Making the Subpage Template</h3>
  <p>First, a template has to be made so that it makes creating the subpages much easier as each subpage has some qualities that remain the same.</p>
  <p>I created a template page on Dream Weaver.</p>

  <h3>Making Subpages</h3>
  <p>Then, I moved on to making the subpages.</p>
  <p>I edited the editable regions by adding the signup sheet on it and the picures.</p>
