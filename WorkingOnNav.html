  <h1>Working On Navigation</h1>
  <p>In order to make the site more interesting, I went on to explore some ways to make navigation bars on Fireworks.</p>

  <h3>Making Buttons</h3>
  <p>First, make boxes with labels in it and then make it a symbol.</p>
  <img src="buttonsProgress1.png"/>
  <p>Afterwards, we can even customize your buttons by playing with the hover or down settings.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="buttons.htm">The Final Product</a></strong></p>

  <h3>Embedding the Buttons to DW</h3>
  <p>Insert an image object (Fireworks htm) to wherever you want your buttons to be, then there might be a bug. The hovering and down settings might not work as the script was not copied to the DW code.
